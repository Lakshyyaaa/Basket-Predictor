Basketball Ball Trajectory Prediction
This project uses computer vision and polynomial regression to track the trajectory of a basketball in a video. The goal is to predict whether the ball will land in the basket based on its current movement.

#Key Features: 
#Color Detection: The ball is tracked by detecting its color using HSV values.
#Trajectory Prediction: Polynomial regression is applied to the ball's movement over time to predict its future trajectory.
#Basket Prediction: Based on the trajectory, the program predicts if the ball will land in the basket.
#Real-time Visualization: Visual indicators such as trajectory lines, ball positions, and predictions (Basket/No Basket) are displayed on the video.

#Technologies Used:
#OpenCV: For video capture, color detection, and drawing the trajectory.
#cvzone: A high-level wrapper for OpenCV that simplifies some tasks, like contour finding.
#NumPy: For polynomial regression to predict the ball's path.
